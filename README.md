# Open Source ROP Modeling


In this repository, the ROP models along with data from liturature are provided.
The goal is to gather the drilling rate of penetration models for both PDC and roller cone bits.
The ROP models are compared versus data from the liturature in python. 
This is an opensource repository and collaborations are welcomed.
